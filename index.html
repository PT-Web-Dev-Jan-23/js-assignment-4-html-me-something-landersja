      <h1>"Who We Are, Understanding Our Journey Up to This Point"</h1>
      <p>You know the type of person who is into any and everything? They usually know one fact or another about the most random subjects. However, when it comes to mastering a field they never dip more than a toe below the water's surface. Next thing you know its 27 years later  and I'm having a quater-life crisis about what is the next step in life? If you couldn't tell by now I'm talking about me. Hello, my name is Jamyria and I don't know how I got here. Yet, as confusing as it is it all makes so much sense.</p>

      <p>We start out as these small, clumsy beings eager to explore the world. In that eagerness there is a foundation built out of curiousity. That drive moves us closer to what we have already known from the beginning about ourselves. Intuitively we gravitate towards the object of our interests with little to no direction. Unfortunately for a lot of us that gentle nudge of our inner voices which used to ring so clearly grew quiet. That voice became overshadowed by others' expectations, emotions, and experiences. This raises the question what is the point of having your own voice if you can't recognize it?  </p>
